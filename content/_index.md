# Hi there!

I'm Will, an undergrad Computer Science student at Northeastern University.

**I don't like magic.** This summarizes what interests me in Software Development. I like to know how things work, which is why I enjoy developing cloud infrastructure, low-level programming, and graphics programming.

Outside of my technical interests, I enjoy running competitively, reading, strategy games (physical and digital), and playing sports. You'll find me out in [Hopkinton, MA](https://www.baa.org/races/boston-marathon/enter/course-information) this 04/20/2026 😄.

This website is still a work in progress, so please [bear](https://github.com/clente/hugo-bearcub/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file) with me if there are any rough edges.
